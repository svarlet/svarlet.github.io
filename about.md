During the last decade, Sébastien has sharpened his teeth on complex frontend, backend and infrastructure problems.

A master of Refactoring, Test Driven Development, and Clean architecture, opportunities have naturally presented themselves to mentor junior, mid and senior engineers.

Over the years, he’s developed an eye for inefficiencies in teams and organizations which he solves by coaching product, engineering and design leaders the philosophy of Lean, Agile, Scrum and LeSS. Sébastien advocates for self-organizing cross-functional teams of product “makers”, placing the customers at the center, and delivering value continuously. Building the right thing - and building it right - requires a rare mindset which has led him to design and run effective hiring processes.
